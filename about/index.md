Welcome to the static-site blog re-incarnation of Codeswamp. Wordpress is good at what it does, but somehow I always felt silly when I was using it. So far this setup (_text editor, markdown, and git_) feels like a comfortable place to write new content.  

As for the old stuff, I'm moving the (few) good bits from the old Codeswamp and Fresh Brewed Code sites as I find time.
